- GPIO
- LCD16x8
- KEYPAD 4x4
- 7-SEGMENTS
- External interrupts
- Analogue to digital conversion
- Timers/PWM
- UART
- SPI
- I2C
# NOTE ON FOLDER PATHS

 the hierarchy of folders is as follows C/" MCU "/"FAMILY OF THE MCU"/" LAYER IN WHICH THE DRIVER EXISTS"/" DRIVER NAME"/
 example: C/AVR DRIVERS/ATMEGA32A/HAL-DRIVERS/GPIO_DRIVER/

# Thank you so much for taking the time to check out my repository.
